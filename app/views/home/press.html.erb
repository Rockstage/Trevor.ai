			<p>Trevor Labs, ltd. is aiming to solve fundamental challenges of time management, in modern-day life, using basic artificial intelligence technology. The company is based in the European Union and was developed with support of the <%= link_to "Founder Institute", "http://fi.co/", :target => "_blank" %>. Founded in February 2016, by <%= link_to "George Petrov", "https://bg.linkedin.com/in/george-petrov-a5b25147", :target => "_blank" %>, Trevor Labs is currently still testing itâ€™s first product - <%= link_to "Trevor", "http://www.trevorai.com/", :target => "_blank" %>, due to be publicly released in Q2 2016. Trevor is an intelligent time management assistant, designed to help you live a more balanced, productive and meaningful day. He integrates with 3rd party productivity tools to allow you to schedule everything you do, right into your calendar. Then he makes smart suggestions for improving your schedule, based on your lifestyle. Finally Trevor provides powerful insights on how you spend your most valuable resource - Time.</p>

			<p>Modern-day productive is becoming increasingly more difficult due to the complexity of tasks, online collaboration and the massive variety of tools. Being productive requires simplicity, discipline and understanding of time. At Trevor Labs, we believe that intelligent software can be used to transform calendar data into powerful personal insights. The only party we give access to this information is the user. The technology works in the background to help you understand more about your lifestyle - the things you do, your good habits, your wasteful tasks, work-life balance, energy levels through the day, and much more.
